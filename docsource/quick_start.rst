Quick Start 
===========

Set up your environment (or activate it) using :ref:`Setting Up Environment` section. 

Census data comes from different resources, and they may have a different formats in different years. The current supported source of data includes:
    
    - ``acs``  American Community Survey
    - ``dec``  Data collected by the decennial census
    - ``pums`` Public use microdata sample

The user needs to get familiar with these data sources and their variables and tables names for each year. In the ``census`` package, one can check the available variables based on year and data source. 



Preparing files and inputs values will be explained later. Each source of data may or may not have specific requested data for each year.
